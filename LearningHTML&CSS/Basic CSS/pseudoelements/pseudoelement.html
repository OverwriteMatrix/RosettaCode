    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>
    The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the quiet town. 
    Birds fluttered lazily between trees, their songs blending with the soft rustle of leaves. 
    A breeze whispered through the streets, carrying the scent of fresh rain. It was one of 
    those peaceful moments where everything felt in sync, as if the world was holding its breath, 
    waiting for something beautiful to happen.
