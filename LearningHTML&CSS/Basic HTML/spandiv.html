        Beneath the silvery veil of a moonlit night, the quiet hum of the forest comes
        alive with whispers of ancient secrets. The air is thick with the scent of pine
        and damp earth, 
        <span style="background-color:tomato;">
        while the soft rustle of leaves and distant hoot of an owl create
        a symphony of nature’s lullabies.
        </span> 
        Shadows dance across the moss-covered ground,
        forming intricate patterns that tell stories of forgotten times. In this serene
        embrace, one can almost feel the heartbeat of the world, a rhythmic pulse that
        connects all living things in an eternal dance of life and mystery.
